This directory is not necessary to the functionning of the code (you can remove it)
It archives the Mathematica program used to write the code in triangle.cpp

build_c_rule.nb is the little Mathematica program used to convert the outputs
of the polyquad program found in directory polyquad_results to the format
expected by triquad_selector::triquad_selector() in triangle.cpp
